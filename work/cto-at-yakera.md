Yakera is a crowdfunding platform that changes how humanitarian aid is delivered around the world. We leverage the power of storytelling to build global solidarity and accelerate international development. Our mission is to empower individuals to tell their stories and create a secure pathway for cash transfers across borders.

In early 2020, we built a static website that served as an About Us page, we used that page to spread awareness and promote our GoFundMe Campaign, which raised 5000$.

In late 2020, we redesigned the website and connected it to our initial backend. People could visit our website and make a supportive donation to help prepare the team for its pilot launch. We raised another 7000$ through that.

In early 2021, we launched our Community Pilot. We displayed 36 campaigns and advertised them through our social media, raising in total 8000$ which we gave 100% to the recipients.

In the summer of 2021, we expanded our development team to 7 developers and hired a designer. We rebranded the website and built a solid and documented back end. We have now launched our official website, where recipients can register and create their own campaigns. If you have read this far it means you are interested in my work, I, therefore, invite you to head over to <https://yakera.org/campaigns> and chip in for the campaigns.
