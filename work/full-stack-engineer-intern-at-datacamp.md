During my internship at Datacamp, I got the chance to develop user-facing software and work alongside talented engineers of various seniority. I received constant exposure to the user-feedback cycle and implemented product features in an agile manner. 

H﻿ere are some of the highlights of my internship:

\- Developed production services using Nest.js leading to a successful project launch to ∼10k customers. 

\- Built and tested a new customer experience using React, Typescript, MFE, Jest, Koa, GraphQL. The release generated great customer feedback indicating the new UX was a success. 

\- Worked in an agile environment alongside engineers of different seniority, completing a new product increment every sprint, focusing on the user feedback loop and modern design. 

\- Facilitated key agile ceremonies including, standups, retrospectives, planning, and demoing new increments to key stakeholders.
