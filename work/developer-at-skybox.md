Skybox is a student-found start-up, that lets you experience the worldâ€™s history in just one touch. We implement personalized immersive experiences into museums to provide more vivid and interactive learning experiences for their visitors. 

In 2018, we launched 2 Virtual Reality (VR) experieneces in the Manchester Museum.

In 2019, we expanded our exhibitions to Augmented Reality (AR). Visitors could scan one of 5 exhibition stickers and the mobile app would immerse them into a Augmented Experience where they can interact with the respective exhibition model. Our application was used over 2000 times on the App and Play Store.

Skybox was part of the AccelerateMe (<https://www.accelerateme.co/>) cohort 2018 /19, where we received funding, office space, and mentorship. Since then, we have appeared at numerous panelist and networking events.

In 2020, we won the runner-up award of the Venture Further Creative Competition. 

Due to COVID-19, and the closure of museums, we converted our idea into developing a mobile world-building game.

In 2021, we pre-released and beta tested our mobile game. Unfortunately, development has paused since then.

* Oversee technical development
