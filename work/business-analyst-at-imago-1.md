We created a progressive web application using React to introduce members of the public and other interested parties to current issues and innovations in bioenergy, for the [UK Supergen Bioenergy Hub](https://www.supergen-bioenergy.net/) research consortium. The application is aimed at promoting better understanding of bioenergy, and the work of the consortium members, at conferences and events. It allows the user to ask questions of bioenergy researchers, learn about bioenergy concepts and facts, and to understand some of the trade-offs involved in implementing bioenergy in practice.

My roles and technical details:

* Analyzed business needs and communicated with our client
* Contributed on the development and testing of the application
* Employed agile principles
* Progressive Web App (PWA) built using React
* Employed a Central Management System (CMS) hosted on Netlify
* E-2-E and unit tested the app using Cypress and Jest
