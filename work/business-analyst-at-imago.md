At Zuhlke I worked alongside experienced developers for 3 months. As part of an internal team, our mission was to create the perfect walking application. The final result was Walker: a web app, which suggests the sunniest time of the day to go on a walk. In addition, Walker calculates a route based on user preferences, such as pace, temperature and distance, while always prioritizing green areas. Users are able to record their walks and log them for future references. Try out Walker for yourself: <https://master.d2su8ceb1kjqz8.amplifyapp.com/> (UPDATE: backend has been disconnected)

In addition to the development cycles, I was exposed to Masterclasses from professionals in different specialisations. I learnt and got to dive myself into advanced Data Science, Project Management, Consulting, Requirement Gathering and Team Programming Cultures.
