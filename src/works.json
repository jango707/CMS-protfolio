As part of an internal team, our mission was to create the perfect walking application. The final result was Walker: a web app, which suggests the sunniest time of the day to go on a walk. In addition, Walker calculates a route based on user preferences, such as pace, temperature and distance, while always prioritizing green areas. Users are able to record their walks and log them for future references. Try out Walker for yourself: <https://master.d2su8ceb1kjqz8.amplifyapp.com/> (UPDATE: backend has been disconnected)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the development cycles, I was exposed to Masterclasses from professionals in different specialisations.

We implement personalized immersive experiences into museums to provide more vivid and interactive learning experiences for their visitors. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, we launched 2 Virtual Reality (VR) experieneces in the Manchester Museum.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, we expanded our exhibitions to Augmented Reality (AR). Visitors could scan one of 5 exhibition stickers and the mobile app would immerse them into a Augmented Experience where they can interact with the respective exhibition model. Our application was used over 2000 times on the App and Play Store.\r\n\r\nSkybox was part of the AccelerateMe (<https://www.accelerateme.co/>) cohort 2018 /19, where we received funding, office space, and mentorship. Since then, we have appeared at numerous panelist and networking events.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, we won the runner-up award of the Venture Further Creative Competition. \r\n\r\nDue to COVID-19, and the closure of museums, we converted our idea into developing a mobile world-building game.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, we pre-released and beta tested our mobile game. Unfortunately, development has paused since then.\r\n\r\nMy role and technical details:\r\n\r\n* Oversee technical development\r\n* Create a mobile application in Unity","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJWxjKOu35k\r","company":"Skybox\r","companyLink":"https://twitter.com/SkyboxGame\r","timePeriod":"October 2018 - March 2021\r"},{"id":1,"title":"Business Analyst at Imago\r","date":"November 17, 2021","time":"12:33","thumbnail":"https://imago.cs.manchester.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/imago-logo-2-300x143.jpg\r","content":"We created a progressive web application using React to introduce members of the public and other interested parties to current issues and innovations in bioenergy, for the [UK Supergen Bioenergy Hub](https://www.supergen-bioenergy.net/) research consortium.
