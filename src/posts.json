We had a couple of ideas but this one seemed the most practical and appealing.\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nIt is a simple retro-themed multiplayer game that you can play online. The difficulty of the game depends on your heartbeat which we tracked using a Mi Band 2 provided to us by the hackathon organisers. The goal of the game is to remain as calm as possible. The calmer you are, the more rewards you get, and the more stressed out you are the fewer you get. We determine whether you are tired or not by finding your initial heartbeat (when you start the game) and then comparing it to your present heartbeat. This is done by collecting 5 data points on startup and then finding their average.\r\n\r\n## How we built it\r\n\r\nWe built the backend server for connecting to a Mi Band 2 and then transmitting that data using a mix of JavaScript and Node.js. The two communicated between each other using XMLHTTPRequests. We built the game in C# using Unity.\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->","demo":"https://devpost.com/software/relaxlane\r","description":"A mobile multiplayer gaming app that tracks your heartbeat to\r"}]
