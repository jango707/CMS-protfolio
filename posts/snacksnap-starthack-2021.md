SnackSnap displays calories in an unorthodox way where user gets to see examples of some physical activities, they would need to pursue in order to burn the given calories. This is done in order to support users to avoid eating snacks. The minutes needed for each physical activity is acquired by using a formula which depends on the body measurements of the user, Metabolic Equivalent for Task (MET) different for each exercise and the calories needed to be burnt. Furthermore, it allows users to keep track of their snacking habits by utilising another functionality, SnackLog.

#### How we built it

We coded in Android Studio by using Flutter to build the application and Firebase to connect with the database. Furthermore, we used Framer to create the prototype designs.
