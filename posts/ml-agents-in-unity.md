I trained my laptop for 15 minutes, using the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit and Python libraries TensorFlow to perform this training.I won't explain how that works, so in case you want to know, I will point you to online documentations, there are great and not so great tutorials about that.

At the end, after only 15 minutes of training, my AI brain was able to score 322 points. That is very good, nice job PC. I wonder what happens if I train for an hour, maybe 5 hours... Could it run infinitely...\
Anyways, this is a very entry-level project and doesn't really require much training to be done. This will serve as a learning project, and I am already excited to what is next, stay tuned for that!
