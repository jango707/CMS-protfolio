Spikes To Heaven is the ultimate proof if you are allowed to heaven...

Jokes aside, spikes to heaven is a strategy platformer where you need to reach heaven, however the road is very spiky and hard, only the most worthy can make it.

The fun part of the game is that at the start you need to choose the size of your player. Each size has certain pros and cons, but at the end you will have a favourite playing style, according to a size. For example, the tiny size can jump very high, but does not have much life. 

It is your challenge to find which size is perfect for you to reach heaven. 

Enjoy the game!
