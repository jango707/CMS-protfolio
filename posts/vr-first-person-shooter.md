I proudly present you my first ever VR Game!\
Using my self made carboard VR headset, I tested this fabulous game. The goal is to shoot all of the stickmen, you move around using your head and you shoot with your voice. So again, because there is no way for me to input anything into the game (no VR hands), I used the microphone to detect a voice threshold, which will fire the gun.
