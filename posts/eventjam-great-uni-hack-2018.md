What better way to pay homage to the 90s than to take inspiration from the classic space jam. With EventJam, the centre of this universe, every planet leads you through a discovery of new and interesting events - where you will very likely meet fellow aliens and monsters for a game of basketball.

Amidst the modern sleek UI, let us take you through a nostalgic journey of annoying popups, gifs, animations, slow page loads, rainbow backgrounds, default colours, all em good things. Be sure to look for all the Easter eggs that we have hidden!

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the space ride!

We built Space Jam using the Ruby on Rails Framework and JavaScript as well.
