I decided to experiment some time on AR and 3D scanning. I used an app called display.land to scan random objects around my place and decided to get a full on scan on a school project. Check out the pics below, I used Google's ARCore and Android Studios to develop the app. Once you scan the object with the app, you can import it to your laptop and edit it using blender. Finally you put it all together in Android Studios, using AR Fragments and theirÂ surface detection API to make an instance of the 3D object appear when you click on a surface. Have fun, Can you tell which is the real and the fake one?
