#### Inspiration

With the current status of wanting to decrease the spread of Covid-19, many countries have declared social distancing. However, people would still need to buy groceries. We wanted to build a platform that will deter people from going to the grocery store during busy times, as mass gatherings pose a higher risk of contracting the virus. Moreover, we also wanted to help people with a higher risk of severe illness by allowing them to create a reservation of the grocery items they wish to get with the help of a volunteer that poses less risk of severe illness.

#### How we built it

We utilised Firebase to deploy our website and used node.js for our backend and NoSQL for the database. For the frontend, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with jQuery and Bootstrap as frameworks. We ended up writing our own API using Python Flask that would get the busy times of any given supermarket. We hosted this on pythonanywhere.com.
